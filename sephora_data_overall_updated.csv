Collagen types I and III are the most abundant forms found in the skin and are important for its structure, elasticity, and firmness. As we age, we lose collagen due to slower production of the protein and also due to collagenase, the enzyme in skin that breaks it down. These two factors are natural bodily processes that contribute to aging and the breakdown of healthy tissue, so it can be helpful to add in a high-quality collagen supplement. The addition of hyaluronic acid helps to hydrate the skin by increasing water retention. Vitamin C, red wine extract, and grapeseed extract are powerful antioxidants that scavenge free radicals to reduce oxidative stress (a major contributor to aging).

<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br> This youth-boosting elixir contains an abundance of Australian wildcrafted ingredients that naturally turn back the clock. Kakadu plum, edelweiss, lilli pilli (also known as ripeberry), and acerola cherry are supercharged with antioxidants to enhance visible firmness, support collagen production, and even tone, while shielding against free radical and UV damage. Hyaluronic acid—which holds 1,000 times its weight in water—plumps and hydrates skin.

<br><br>Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.
<br><br>Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

The mask is also powered by the Japanese beautyberry, a superfruit rich in antioxidants that was found to stabilize vitamin C, maximizing its effectiveness. A gentle 10 percent AHA complex of seven fruits removes debris and the buildup of dead skin cells to visibly improve skin texture and support the natural production of new skin cells.

The verdict was unanimous: other than time-consuming facials that took weeks (even months), nothing gave instant glowing results. With willing celebrities as test subjects, they set out to create a solution. After researching, they found a small, family-owned lab to make the formula, filled it in plain-white sample jars at home and hand-delivered it. Wowed by the results, word spread fast in Hollywood. Top entertainment executives, A-list actors, musicians, and celebrity makeup artists all called requesting the ""no-name magic mud."" Within a year, it was used all over Hollywood.

<br><br>Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.
<br><br>Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

Sephora,HUM Nutrition,Wing Man Liver Detox and Dark Circle Supplement,face cream,"Beauty Benefit: Gut HealthWhat it is:  A supplement for full liver support—so you don’t have to refuse that glass of chardonnay. What it Tastes Like: No flavor When to Expect Results: Four to six weeksWhat Else You Need to Know: Protect your organs, visibly diminish dark under-eye circles, and cleanse your system with this supportive supplement. Milk thistle (containing potent and powerful silymarin), dandelion root, and artichoke leaf combine for a full-on liver detox—perfect for the party animal in all of us*. Silymarin, the active compound in milk thistle, may contribute to the liver’s antioxidant defense by enhancing glutathione. Milk thistle has been clinically shown to help regenerate liver cells and support detox mechanisms. Research has also looked into silymarin as a potent antioxidant—a compound that blocks the action of cell-damaging free radicals. A clinical study found that humans who consumed dandelion extract over a 24-hour period produced significantly more urine than they had in each of the previous two days. Some preliminary research suggests that dandelion may help support liver and gallbladder function. Limited trials found artichoke-leaf extract to have a modest positive effect on cholesterol levels. Antioxidant, bile-enhancing, and lipid-lowering effects have been demonstrated as well, which corresponds with the historical use of the plant. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

<br>Internationally renowned makeup artist Natasha Denona developed her own eyeshadow formulas after struggling for over 20 years with eyeshadows that were dry, dull, and difficult to blend.

<br>
<br>""When I launched these palettes everyone told me I was crazy because there are so many shades inside. I made them like this because I had to create a kit with all the basic colors that came in cool tones and warm tones from light to dark and in several textures. My 28 Palettes have become world renowned and the favorites of Desi Perkins, Nikki Tutorials, Wayne Goss, Kathleen Lights, and Jaclyn Hill. The formula is out of this world! It was a dream for me to create a pressed pigment that was easy for everyone to use. You can create endless looks with the 28 Palette. It’s a revolutionary product and a must have for everyone.""—Natasha Denona

<br><br>Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.
<br><br>Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.
